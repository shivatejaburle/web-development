                The &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
            </li>
            <li>
                The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
            </li>
            <li>
                The &lt;title&gt; element:
                    <ul>
                        <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
                        <li>provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
                        <li>displays a title for the page in search-engine results</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Some tips for creating good titles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)</li>
                        <li>Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that</li>
                        <li>Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!</p>

        <p><b>Note: </b>You can NOT have more than one &lt;title&gt; element in an HTML document.</p>
