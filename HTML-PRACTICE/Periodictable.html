            <p>The periodic table has been designed to serves a purpose. With each element placed according to its atomic weight and number.</p>
            <p>The horizonal rows are the periods and the vertical columns are groups</p>

            <p>The element box has each elements information is known as the element key. Each key contains the elements name, atomic weight, atomic number.</p>
            <p>The elements atomic number let's you find out how many protons are in the nucleus, and also how many eletrons are in circling around it.</p>
            <p>Every element on the periodic table will have a atomic number given to it. This will allow you to count the protons and eletrons, but it also decides where on the table the elements is placed</p>
