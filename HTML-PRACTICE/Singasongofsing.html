            Sing a song of 6,
            pence A pocket full of rye.
            4 and 20 blackbirds,
            Big in a 5.

            When the pie was opened,
            The birds began to sing;
            and Wasn't that a dainty dish,
            To set before the king?

            The king was in his counting house,
            Counting out his money;
            The queen was in the parlor,
            Eating bread and honey.

            The maid was in the garden,
            Hanging out the cloth,
            When down came a blackbird
            And pecked off her nose.
