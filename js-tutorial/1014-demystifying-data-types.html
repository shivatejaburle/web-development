        <h1>Demystifying Data Types</h1>
        <p>Demystifying means confusion, whenever you're working with someone code, you might not know what the variable type necessarily.</p>
        <p>Variables can go through a lot of different states and, you know, maybe a variable is list at one point or an array.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's an object at another point, maybe it's a string and at another point, maybe it's a number.</p>
        <p>At some point, ideally that doesn't happen, but occasionally it does.</p>
        <p>So you can always run a particular function called <strong>typeof()</strong>.</p>
        <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
        <p>
            let var1 = "JavaScript";<br>
            console.log("var1 is " + typeof(var1));<br><br>

            let var2 = 1990;<br>
            console.log("var2 is " + typeof(var2));<br><br>

            let var3 = ["Item 1", "Item 2"];<br>
            console.log("var3 is " + typeof(var3));<br><br>

            let var4 = true;<br>
            console.log("var4 is " + typeof(var4));
        </p>
        <p><b>Output:</b></p>
        <p>
            var1 is string<br>
            var2 is number<br>
            var3 is object<br>
            var4 is boolean
        </p>

        <script>
            let var1 = "JavaSCript";
            console.log("var1 is " + typeof(var1));

            let var2 = 1990;
            console.log("var2 is " + typeof(var2));

            let var3 = ["Item 1", "Item 2"];
            console.log("var3 is " + typeof(var3));

            let var4 = true;
            console.log("var4 is " + typeof(var4));
        </script>
