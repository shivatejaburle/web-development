        <h1>Strict Equality Vs Loose Equality</h1>
        <p>The Loose Equality Operator <q><strong>==</strong></q> allows us to compare two or more operands by converting their value to a common type first and then checking for the equality between them.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            let num = "0";<br>
            console.log(typeof(num));<br>
            console.log(num == "0");<br>
            console.log(num == 0);<br>
        </p>
        <p>The Strict Equality Operator <q><strong>===</strong></q> allows us to compare two or more operands by checking the equality between the values as well as their types . It returns true only if the values and the type both match with the other operand.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            let num = "0";<br>
            console.log(typeof(num));<br>
            console.log(num === "0");<br>
            console.log(num === 0);<br>
        </p>
        <p>Strict comparisons are faster for processing and you're going to see these in the future and in production level code.</p>
